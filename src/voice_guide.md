# Key Writing Points

## Structure & Flow
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items; numbered lists for sequential steps
- Add subheadings every 200-300 words to break up content
- Avoid using the structure: "It's not this, it's that" - a typical LLM framing device

## Technical Writing
- Spell out acronyms on first use, then use the acronym consistently
- Format code/commands in backticks: `sudo apt update`
- Link to primary sources; archive important links
- Explain technical concepts in plain language first, then add technical detail

## Tone & Voice
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Write in second person ("you") for instructional content
- Match technical depth to audience level
- Balance informative tone with urgency (avoid fear-mongering)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Weak qualifiers: "quite," "rather," "somewhat," "pretty much"
- Don't start sentences with "So" - it's weak and conversational
- Overused transitions: "however," "moreover," "furthermore"
- Corporate jargon: "leverage," "synergy," "best practices"
- Limit em dashes to 3 maximum per piece (fewer is better)

## Cybersecurity-Specific
- Explain attacks/threats in terms of business impact
- Use specific examples over generic scenarios
- Mention vendors/products neutrally (avoid appearing promotional)
- Focus on actionable advice, not just problems
