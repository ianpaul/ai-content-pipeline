notes: |
  - Style/voice preservation is CRITICAL - user's individual writing style must be maintained above all else
  - This is content with personal touches that is being improved, not corporate content being created from scratch
  - Apply brand guidelines WITHOUT altering the user's authentic voice and personality
  - Preserve user's word choices, sentence patterns, analogies, and unique expressions
  - Risk flags marked as "blocking: true" require resolution before advancement
