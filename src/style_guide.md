description: "Voice, tone, and written style guidelines for editorial agents. Customize for your brand and industry."

# Voice and Tone

* **Bold**  
  * Use short, punchy words and sentences (~15 words).  
  * Prefer simple over complex: *use*, not *utilize*; *help*, not *assistance*.  
  * Use imperatives: "Work smarter. Cut costs."  
  * Use repetition sparingly for emphasis.  
  * Prefer present tense for immediacy.

* **Human**  
  * Focus on *you* (the reader) and *we* over company name.  
  * Write like you speak: clear, active voice, verb-driven.  
  * Avoid industry-specific jargon and unexplained acronyms.  
  * Use technical vocabulary only when needed, and explain benefits.  
  * Avoid slang, clichés, violent metaphors, SHOUTY CAPS, or excessive exclamation marks.

* **Inclusive**  
  * Always use gender-neutral, inclusive language.  
  * Avoid gendered, age-based, class-based, or wealth-based terms.  
  * Examples: *staffing* not *manpower*, *artificial* not *man-made*.

* **Authentic**  
  * All claims must be defensible and backed by data.  
  * Cite sources properly and verify accessibility.  
  * Never include confidential data in AI prompts.  
  * Maintain integrity—avoid hype, overpromises, or fabricated statistics.

# Written Style

* **Base Style**: AP Style (Associated Press), with deviations as described in this guide.

* **Grammar & Punctuation**  
  * One space after periods.  
  * Commas/periods inside quotes.  
  * Oxford comma preferred (but can omit if meaning is clear).  
  * Numbers: spell out one–nine; use digits for 10+.  
  * List items: no periods at the end.  
  * Date format must be explicit: e.g., *January 1, 2025*.

* **Common Terms & Usage**  
  * Acronyms: spell out on first use (e.g., *return on investment (ROI)*).  
  * *Real time* (noun), *real-time* (adjective).  
  * *Data center* (noun), *data-driven* (adjective).  
  * Avoid unnecessary capitalization of common terms.

# Brand Language

* **Company Reference**  
  * Use full company name on first mention, shorter version thereafter.  
  * Formal contexts: use complete legal name.  
  * Informal contexts: use common brand name.

* **Product Names**  
  * Full product name on first use (with acronym if applicable).  
  * Prefer product names as adjectives when possible.  
  * Thereafter, acronym/product name may stand alone.

* **Proprietary Terms**  
  * Always capitalize proprietary company terms and product names.  
  * Never reference unannounced products or internal codenames externally.

# Content Creation Guidelines

* **Human First, AI Second**: Treat AI output as a draft. Add company expertise and voice.  
* **Open Strong**: Avoid generic openers ("In today's fast-paced world..."). Start with bold statements or insights.  
* **Personalize with Purpose**: Write as if to one person. Use dynamic fields thoughtfully.  
* **Verify Everything**: Never trust AI-generated statistics or claims without verifiable sources.  
* **Tone**:  
  * Sharp, informed, confident (but not arrogant).  
  * Conversational but professional.  
  * Engaging, where appropriate, without undermining credibility.

# Confidentiality Guidelines

* **Internal Only**: Sensitive information requiring special handling. Label: `[Internal Only]`  
* **Confidential**: Internal use, requires agreement for external sharing. Label: `[Confidential]`  
* **Public**: Safe for all audiences. No label required.

# Tone Constraints

* Confident but not arrogant: never aggressive or dismissive.  
* Clarity over complexity: write for all audiences.  
* Concise, structured writing. Brevity demonstrates strength.  
* Avoid unnecessarily negative language or fear-mongering.

# Content Quality Checklist

* [ ] Inclusive, neutral language throughout
